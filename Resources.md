# Resources and tutorials

## Learning python
* A bare-bones, interactive [tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) in python basics, with a more detailed version available for purchase at DataCamp.

## Shell scripting in bash
Bash is the most commonly used shell scripting language in minutes systems, and is often the default.  It is the go-to for scientific processing workflows, and can be used to run other programs: python, matlab, etc. It is delightfully old-school, yet highly powerful.

### Step one: install the windows subsystem for linux
...or Docker, or Virtual Box. WSL is available from the microsoft [store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for free.

1. Lynda tutorial on ["Linux: Bash Shell and Scripts"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/linux-bash-shell-and-scripts/) - requires LinkedIn Learning membership, which Brown subscribes to. Information should be fairly easy to understand, but will take some time to watch the videos.

2. [The linux documentation project](http://tldp.org/guides.html) - lots of useful, if dated, guides and code snippets to learn with. For a quick crash course, or info on a specific topic, try the [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html) by Machtelt Garrels and [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) by Mendel Cooper.

## Geocomputation workflows

1. [Geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io/): An up-to-date resource for geoprocessing workflows in Python, introduced through a series of Jupiter notebook tutorials. Thanks to The University of Washington organizers for offering these workshops and archiving the tutorials!

2. Spatial-ecology.net workshops and [tutorials](http://spatial-ecology.net/dokuwiki/doku.php): Now preserved on Youtube, this site gives introductions to a variety of geospatial processing, including command line programs like gdal, and GIS software like QGIS and GRASS. Includes some intorudction to linux and bash as well. Thank you to Giuseppe Amatulli at Yale for hosting this site.

## Data science/machine learning

1. Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Sciences workshop (https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/events/summer-school/ai4ess/2020/artificial-intelligence-earth-system-science-ai4ess-summer-school): includes archived workshop tutorials and jupyter notebooks, organized by NCAR.
