## Learning programming
1. [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](https://howtothink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): An online, html textbook for an introduction to programming (in Python 3). Referenced in MIT 6.00.
2. [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks) courses. These require a paid membership, but I think it's well worth the money: there are no ads, the lessons have built-in code editors with hints and auto-"grading", and the content is pared down to the essentials.

## Learning python
Python and its numerical array programming package, numpy, have become so ubiquitous in the sciences that they were the topic of a 2020 review [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2) in Nature!

1. A [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) provided by the developers of python- not recommended for beginners because it is quite formal and technical. Good for reference, though.

2. [An introduction to Python for scientific computing](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/python.pdf) (M. Scott Shell / UCSB) - To the point and written by a biochemical modeling professor

3. [Python Like You Mean It](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/): this looks good! Written by a former physics grad student who wished something like this had existed when they started. Described as "a free resource for learning the basics of Python & NumPy, and moreover, becoming a competent Python user," and "a lean, one-stop resource for learning the essentials of Python from scratch."

4. Basic, interactive [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) from W3Schools.com with advertisements.

5. A bare-bones, interactive, 10-minute-long [tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) in python basics, with a more detailed version available for purchase at DataCamp.

6. MIT 6.00: [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/): How Ethan learned programming and python. Not recommended because it is quite verbose! It is also taught in python 2.xx, while python 3.xx is now current. 

7. [An Introduction to Numpy and Scipy](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/numpy.pdf)  (M. Scott Shell / UCSB) - A great introduction to the basic functions available in numpy. Can also be used as a reference guide.

8. Matplotlib plotting style [guide](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)

9. One-page "cheat sheets" for common python data science packages:
 * [Numpy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Numpy_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
 * Many others...just google cheat sheets for numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, xarray

10. Old school? Here are some textbooks:
* [Primer on Scientific Programming with Python](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.revproxy.brown.edu/lib/brown/detail.action?docID=1030580) Hans Petter Langtangen, Springer, 2012. (Available online through Brown library)
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://www-oreilly-com.revproxy.brown.edu/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/?ar) (Jake VanderPlas) - more recent, includes linear regression, machine learning, and one computer vision application. (Available online through Brown library)
* [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools,and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781838826048/) by Aurélien Géron (available online through Brown Library)
* [Earth Observation using Python: A Practical Programming Guide](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Earth+Observation+using+Python%3A+A+Practical+Programming+Guide-p-9781119606888) by Rebekah B. Esmaili, 2021 - Written by a friend of Jessica's. An up-to-date overview of modern satellites, all the necessary python packages for loading, manipulating, and plotting their data, an intro to python, and many practical examples. Stops short of data analysis and machine learning.

2. Geohackweek and Intro to Earth Data Science online textbook chapters

## Introduction to the Linux operating system
The following tutorials are recommended by the [NASA Center for Climate Simulation](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/nccs-users/instructional/adapt-instructional):
* Introduction to Linux [Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)
* More Advanced Linux [Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/index.htm)

* Linux [Handbook](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/) on file-permissions and ownership.

## Shell scripting in bash
Bash is the most commonly used shell scripting language in minutes systems, and is often the default.  It is the go-to for scientific processing workflows, and can be used to run other programs: python, matlab, etc. It is delightfully old-school, yet highly powerful.

### Step one: install the windows subsystem for linux
...or Docker, Virtual Box, or git-bash. WSL is available from the microsoft [store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for free and I find it the most convenient way to run Linux on a Windows machine in a fast, low-resource way. Bonus: WSL integrates with the text editor Visual Studio Code.

1. Lynda tutorial on ["Linux: Bash Shell and Scripts"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/linux-bash-shell-and-scripts/): requires LinkedIn Learning membership, which Brown subscribes to. Information should be fairly easy to understand, but will take some time to watch the videos.

2. [The linux documentation project](http://tldp.org/guides.html): lots of useful, if dated, guides and code snippets to learn with. For a quick crash course, or info on a specific topic, try the [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html) by Machtelt Garrels and [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) by Mendel Cooper.

## Geocomputation workflows

1. [Geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io/): An up-to-date resource for geoprocessing workflows in Python, introduced through a series of python Jupiter notebook tutorials. Thanks to The University of Washington organizers for offering these workshops and archiving the tutorials!

2. Spatial-ecology.net workshops and [tutorials](http://spatial-ecology.net/dokuwiki/doku.php): Now preserved on Youtube, this site gives introductions to a variety of geospatial processing, including command line programs like gdal, and GIS software like QGIS and GRASS.

## Geospatial plotting and map packages for python
Although python is excellent at managing and processing geospatial data, visualizing it beyond simple `matplotlib` plots is less seamless. Packages that require enabling jupyterlab extensions seem to be more prone to dependency conflicts. See this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-must-have-jupyterlab-extensions-for-geospatial-data-science-f3cf7822de4b) for some inspo. Dr. Qiusheng Wu sums up the need for versatile geospatial packages in the ["Statement of Need"](https://github.com/giswqs/leafmap) for leafmap.
1. [leafmap](https://github.com/giswqs/leafmap) by Qiusheng Wu. Amazing package, and my favorite among these! It does require enabling jupyterlab widgets, but I didn't experience any glitches. I installed in a new environmnt, initially, as recommended. I think you can get away with just `conda install -c conda-forge leafmap` and enable the corresponding jupyterlab extension. Requires xarray-leaflet for loading locally-stored rasters.
2. [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) (since 2016, originated from matplotlib + [basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html#), which is now deprecated) - "originally developed at the UK Met Office" - simple [tutorial](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/matplotlib/intro.html#beautifully-simple-maps). Another [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CozylyIqLGKZLIeHX16YkGhMl9L7gcO7#scrollTo=-4yBq1aPXmB0) in Google Colab from [EEPS1960d](https://sites.google.com/view/eeps1960d-spring2021/home). I don't believe maps are interactive unless you install the ipympl interactive [widget](https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl) and enable with `%matplotlib widget` Basemaps need to be downloaded with a line of code.
3. [plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) (via [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/maps) + [dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)) - [examples](https://plotly.com/python/maps/)
4. [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) - good basemap functionality with one line of code. To plot rasters, you must reproject to match rest of map, convert to 8bit and remove NaNs (requires rioxarray). [Tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/scientists-guide-to-plotting-data-in-python/plot-spatial-data/customize-raster-plots/interactive-maps/) from earthdatascience.org
5. ipyleaflet - recommended in geohackweek, but I had dependency issues with other packages and jupyterlab extensions
6. geoviews - recommended in geohackweek, and it works successfully using bokeh for visualizations, although slowly.
7. [whitebox-python](https://github.com/giswqs/whitebox-python) by Qiusheng Wu
8. [geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap) by Qiusheng Wu. Interface to GEE. Very well documented with huge user community.
9. [GeoJSON](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/tree/master/packages/geojson-extension) - a simple way of mapping geojson files or text strings with a basemap in a new jupyter tab or notebook cell. Not designed for viewing multiple layers. Requires enabling jupyterlab extensions
10. ggplot for python?
11. [mapbox-gl](https://github.com/mapbox/mapboxgl-jupyter) - I've never used, but it's also in the [tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/scientists-guide-to-plotting-data-in-python/plot-spatial-data/customize-raster-plots/interactive-maps/) from earthdatascience.org. Requires free MapBox Access Token to view basemaps, and is supposedly less well-documented than folium.
12. [keplergl](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl). Built around mapbox-gl and optimized for big data and 3d visualizations. Looks complicated to install. Requires enabling jupyterlab extensions
13. [contextlily](https://contextily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Used for basemaps in plots - "is a small Python 3 (3.7 and above) package to retrieve tile maps from the internet. It can add those tiles as basemap to matplotlib figures or write tile maps to disk into geospatial raster files. Bounding boxes can be passed in both WGS84 (EPSG:4326) and Spheric Mercator (EPSG:3857)."

## Deep Learning
1. [satellite-image-deep-learning](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning) - Robin Cole - An amazing compilation of tools for every stage in the process for running neural networks on satellite images. Links to dozens of other repos with descriptions of what they are used for.
2. [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/about/) - Making deep learning training accessible. "Deep learning is transforming the world. We are making deep learning easier to use and getting more people from all backgrounds involved through our: free courses for coders, software library, cutting-edge research, community" Written about in The Economnist, NY Times, MIT Tech Review.

## Python environments
Not all of these packages play together nicely, and I have spent a lot of time trying to fix dependency conflicts within my geospatial conda environments. This is completely typical for open-source software, but the benefits outweight the cost, in my opinion! In general, I have found the best ways of fixing conflicts is starting from scratch and installing as few packages as possible. You can re-create an environment from only the packages you explicitly installed, and not from whatever dependencies were necessary at the time using the conda command: `conda env export --from-history`. I have found this command helpful in these scenarios.

Fortunately, there are some great resources for existing geospatial python environments. Check out the environment files in:
* Geohackweek tutorial [environments](https://github.com/geohackweek/tutorial_contents) conda `environment.yml` files for the various exercises. As far as I can tell, they don't provide a combined environment that works for everything.
* [Earth Analytics python environment](https://github.com/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env/blob/main/environment.yml) - developed for the Earth Data Analytics Online Certificate courses 

My new favorite method is a package that automatically installs a very complete geospatial environment when you install it:
* [Python-geospatial](https://github.com/giswqs/python-geospatial) by Qiusheng Wu, many great links within.

Other compilations of python and GIS tools
* [Awesome GIS](https://github.com/sshuair/awesome-gis) - Awesome GIS is a collection of geospatial related sources, including cartographic tools, geoanalysis tools, developer tools, data, conference & communities, news, massive open online course, some amazing map sites, and more.
* [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) - A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources.
