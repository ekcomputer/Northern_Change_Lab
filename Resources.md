# Resources and tutorials

## All-in-one tutorials for earth data science
* Earth Lab at University of Colorado, Boulder: 
  * [Online "textbook:" Introduction to Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/) - zero to hero tutorial covering bash, python, git/github, and data science workflows - The best all in one tutorial on these topics I have seen!
  * [Workshop: Get Started With GIS in Open Source Python - Geopandas, Rasterio & Matplotlib](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/gis-open-source-python/) - Covers similar material to geohackweek, but with more brevity

## Learning python
* A bare-bones, interactive [tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) in python basics, with a more detailed version available for purchase at DataCamp.

## Shell scripting in bash
Bash is the most commonly used shell scripting language in minutes systems, and is often the default.  It is the go-to for scientific processing workflows, and can be used to run other programs: python, matlab, etc. It is delightfully old-school, yet highly powerful.

### Step one: install the windows subsystem for linux
...or Docker, Virtual Box, or git-bash. WSL is available from the microsoft [store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for free and I find it the most convenient way to run Linux on a Windows machine in a fast, low-resource way. Bonus: WSL integrates with the text editor Visual Studio Code.

1. Lynda tutorial on ["Linux: Bash Shell and Scripts"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/linux-bash-shell-and-scripts/) - requires LinkedIn Learning membership, which Brown subscribes to. Information should be fairly easy to understand, but will take some time to watch the videos.

2. [The linux documentation project](http://tldp.org/guides.html) - lots of useful, if dated, guides and code snippets to learn with. For a quick crash course, or info on a specific topic, try the [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html) by Machtelt Garrels and [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) by Mendel Cooper.

## Geocomputation workflows

1. [Geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io/): An up-to-date resource for geoprocessing workflows in Python, introduced through a series of Jupiter notebook tutorials. Thanks to The University of Washington organizers for offering these workshops and archiving the tutorials!

2. Spatial-ecology.net workshops and [tutorials](http://spatial-ecology.net/dokuwiki/doku.php): Now preserved on Youtube, this site gives introductions to a variety of geospatial processing, including command line programs like gdal, and GIS software like QGIS and GRASS. Includes some introduction to linux and bash as well. Thank you to Giuseppe Amatulli at Yale for hosting this site.

## Data science/machine learning

1. Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Sciences workshop (https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/events/summer-school/ai4ess/2020/artificial-intelligence-earth-system-science-ai4ess-summer-school): includes archived workshop tutorials and jupyter notebooks, organized by NCAR.
